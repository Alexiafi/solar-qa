The results are obviously not in accord with the optical properties of ZrO 2 .Indeed, while the amount of CO evolution decreased apparently as the cut wavelength became longer, light with wavelengths \u03bb > 290 nm could promote the reaction.This result suggests that excitation of bulk ZrO", "of H 2 was very fast at the beginning and then slowed.The amount of consumed H 2 was quite larger than that of evolved CO at all times.These suggest that some compounds containing hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen were accumulated on the surface during the photoreaction. We then tried to decompose adsorbed species by heating the catalyst sample after the photoirradiation.More CO evolution was observed, while the amount of desorbed H 2 was very small.Thus, after 6 h photoirradiation, 1.0 \u00b5mol of CO was detected, as mentioned above, and when the catalyst sample was heated at 673 K for 20 min after 2 min evacuation (heat treatment), 3.3 \u00b5mol of CO was evolved.When the photoirradiation time was extended to 40.5 h, 3.2 \u00b5mol of CO was formed, and by the heat treatment, 5.8 \u00b5mol of CO was evolved.This observation shows that photoirradiation to the catalyst surface produces some material which is decomposed into CO by heat.

Photoreduction of CO 2 over ZrO 2 was also conducted with methane [36].Figure 7 shows the time dependence of CO formation under photoirradiation (thick line).The amount of CO formation increases with the irradiation time, although the rate of CO formation is slightly slowed down.Without photoirradiation, even a trace of CO was not detected, although CO 2 adsorption on zirconium oxide does not need photoexcitation.When the short wavelength region (\u03bb < 290 nm) in the irradiation light was cut off by a glass filter, merely a small amount of CO (0.1 \u00b5mol) was evolved.In the case that CO 2 or CH 4 alone was admitted to the reactor, no CO was detected even after UV irradiation.From these results, we concluded that this reaction was a photoreaction, not a thermal redox reaction between ZrO 2 and CO 2 , or between CH 4 and ZrO 2 .In other words, the C-H bond of methane is activated in the presence of carbon dioxide on ZrO 2 under irradiation.

Methane evolution on Cu(0.5 wt%)-Fe(0.5wt%)/TiO 2 -SiO 2 -acac photocatalyst (0.279 lmol/g-cat h) is higher than that on  2 that TiO 2 -SiO 2acac photocatalysts are not photoactive towards ethylene production under UVA.This result could be ascribed to the much lower redox potential of methane as compared with that of ethylene [41].When TiO 2 -SiO 2 is doped with Cu and Fe metals, the resulting photocatalysts show substantial difference in hydrocarbon production as well as product selectivity.It is well known that the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 on single-crystal copper electrodes may form various kinds of hydrocarbon products depending on its index planes [42,43].Fe as a co-dopant on Cu/TiO 2 -SiO 2 photocatalyst was", "2 O to various kinds of products that include significant amount of ethylene and methane as well as trace amount of ethane and methanol.The optical-fiber photoreactor is maintained at 75 \u00b0C to assure that all light hydrocarbons could reach the GC detector.Consequently, no hydrocarbon product in the form of liquid was observed by naked eyes in the reactor after the photocatalytic reaction.Furthermore, owing to high redox potentials of longchain hydrocarbons, the photoreduction of CO 2 with H 2 O over Cu-Fe/TiO 2 -SiO 2 photocatalysts to these products is impossible under UVA light and natural sunlight. Table 2 lists the production rate of methane and ethylene over two kinds of photocatalysts under UVA.The evolution of methane is observed for two photocatalysts in which a maximum production rate of 1.860 lmol/g-cat h is measured on Cu(0.5 wt%)-Fe(0.5wt%)/TiO 2 -SiO 2 -acac photocatalyst.Meanwhile, ethylene is only produced on photocatalysts doped with Cu and Fe metals.

When illuminated by UV light with a sufficient photonic energy (hn) and an appropriate wavelength, photon-generated electrons (e \u00c0 ) and holes (h + ) are created on the surface of the TiO 2 catalysts (Eqs.( 2) and ( 3)).Furthermore, the photoexcited electrons and holes in the lattice are separated and trapped by the appropriate sites of TiO 2 to avoid recombination.The holes first react with water adsorbed on the catalyst, producing oxygen and H + (Eq.( 4)).The interaction of H + ions with the excited electrons leads to the formation of H", "catalyst, producing oxygen and H + (Eq.( 4)).The interaction of H + ions with the excited electrons leads to the formation of H radicals (Eq.( 5)).At the same time, CO 2 \u00c0 radicals are formed from CO 2 (Eq.( 6)).These incipient CO 2 \u00c0 and H radicals react with each other to produce CO (Eq.( 7)).Then the CH 3 radical is formed from CO by consecutive reactions (Eqs.( 8)-( 13)).The methane is formed by the reaction with the H radical (reaction ( 14)), while methanol is formed by the reaction with OH (reaction ( 15)).Hydrogen is formed by the reaction of H radical (Eq.( 16)).Generated free oxygen (Eq.( 4)) can be partially consumed by re-oxidation of methane.Tan et al.
